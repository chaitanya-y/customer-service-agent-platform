## Current checkpoint — 2026-09-15

The bounded measurement baseline is frozen and the quality gate is **not green**.
The authorized v4 large-refund trial completed execution but failed its blocking
reviewed-policy answer check: the response stayed generic and retained one RAG
citation instead of presenting the required USD 750 request against the USD 500
specialist-review threshold. Context precision, context recall, and faithfulness
were 1.0;
response relevancy was 0.5704 and factual correctness (precision) was 0.33.
No retry was performed.

The preceding v3 campaign attempted five cases three times (15 attempts): five
answers were scored, ten were `SYSTEM_ERROR`, and zero cases passed all three
repetitions. Human review/calibration is incomplete. LangSmith export and Tau
benchmarking have not started. These results are evaluation evidence, not a
production reliability claim.

## Evidence and guides

- [Closure review](RAGAS_CLOSURE_REVIEW.md): frozen v4 measurement, exact scores,
  usage, review preparation, and next approval boundary.
- [v4 policy-answer guide](RAGAS_V4_POLICY_ANSWER.md): offline implementation and
  the deterministic policy-answer criterion.
- [v3 baseline](RAGAS_V3_BASELINE.md): five-case campaign results and scored
  coverage.
- [Evaluation strategy](EVALUATION_STRATEGY.md): evaluation sequence, gates, and
  limits.
- [Evaluation Runner guide](../../apps/services/evaluation-runner/README.md):
  datasets, offline commands, safeguards, and result interpretation.

## Other measured foundations

The local retrieval check covered five cases against 18 chunks: Recall@3 was
1.0, MRR was 1.0, and forbidden-evidence rate was 0.0. Agent-runtime coverage
includes seven core cases plus one retrieval-outage case offline; this is not a
full workflow evaluation. This documentation update introduces no new product
behavior, paid run, service operation, secret, or refund action.

## Safe reading order

1. Read the [Codex handoff](../CODEX_HANDOFF.md) for repository-wide context.
2. Read the [closure review](RAGAS_CLOSURE_REVIEW.md) for the latest measured
   status and explicit limitations.
3. Use the [Evaluation Runner guide](../../apps/services/evaluation-runner/README.md)
   before running any command; paid calls require separate explicit approval.
