# Reference Document Manifest

Last updated: 2026-10-04

## Precedence

1. Accepted ADRs and `docs/architecture/KLEEM_AI_ARCHITECTURE_V1_1.md`
2. Current repository code and canonical contracts
3. Current handoff and runbook Markdown
4. Product PDFs
5. Version 1.0 architecture baseline appendix

If two sources conflict, use the higher-precedence source and record a new ADR for
any deliberate architecture change.

## Architecture files

- `architecture/Kleem_AI_Combined_HLD_and_LLD_Architecture.pdf` is the
  September 20 version 1.1 combined PDF snapshot. Its 10-page amendment records
  the architecture and observability state at that date, followed
  by the complete original document as an immutable baseline appendix. Pages: 193.
  SHA-256:
  `62a9601ccc7648198e8e1d260226649103ec56e520b3a1f412012c72d84d78ce`.
- `architecture/Kleem_AI_Combined_HLD_and_LLD_Architecture_v1.0_baseline.pdf` is an
  immutable copy of the original 183-page architecture document. SHA-256:
  `dc336b4b3994736d4dc3f07bef0c649866ce5d98096f78f73c2ffb547fec1b71`.
- `../architecture/KLEEM_AI_ARCHITECTURE_V1_1.md` is the searchable authoritative
  source for current decisions, including local journeys added after the PDF
  was generated. The PDF has not been regenerated for those changes.

The September 20 amendment includes the current component boundaries, durable
Human Operations persistence, planned Model Gateway status, implemented local
observability boundary and remaining production gaps. Detailed test evidence,
RAGAS results and dated operational checks remain in
[Verification Status](../VERIFICATION_STATUS.md), [the handoff](../CODEX_HANDOFF.md)
and [the evaluation strategy](../evaluation/EVALUATION_STRATEGY.md). Share those
Markdown files alongside the PDF when handing off work. The combined PDF was
rendered and visually checked at the amendment and appendix boundary; the baseline
checksum remains unchanged.

## Product files

- `product/Customer_Agent_OS_Lite_Project_Overview.pdf`, 17 pages, SHA-256
  `d2fab8928e0e52233ad9684493e575a11a4cba6ec7793317855b621d0824732d`.
- `product/Customer_Agent_OS_Lite_V1_Product_Contract.pdf`, 18 pages, SHA-256
  `02684bfb805371aa9b0b5e4f424c924d8f07c98de9ff8adbe9e5b570f14fc56e`.
- `product/Customer_Agent_OS_Lite_Fixed_Product_Features.pdf`, 14 pages, SHA-256
  `544fdbf7b0550fb169ad6a77cdc37396b3f608ce4a38cf3b457c2ae1f852f189`.

These product PDFs remain useful. They describe intent and scope, while the current
architecture amendment records implementation changes made during the refund
walking skeleton.

## Excluded reference

`productionRAG.pdf` is not copied into the repository. It was used as a learning
reference, but its redistribution rights are not established. The project's own
RAG architecture and implementation are documented in the current architecture
source and code.

Never put credentials, tokens, `.env` files, local databases, or private customer
data in this directory.
