# Local Refund Journey Runbook

This guide starts and tests the implemented local refund journey. It is for a
development machine, not deployment.

## What this test proves

The browser path proves that a customer request is authenticated at the Edge,
processed by the LangGraph refund agent, grounded with customer-safe knowledge,
checked against trusted Vendure facts, evaluated by deterministic policy, and
handed to a human case when policy requires it.

The safest end-to-end demonstration is the **takeover path**. It creates and
resolves a Human Operations case but does not submit a refund to Vendure.
The positive photo-gated exceptional-refund path passed locally on 2026-09-06,
including a clearer-photo request, exact replacement-revision acceptance,
same-case monetary takeover, supervisor plan approval, exact customer
confirmation and settlement of the one existing simulated refund. Temporal and
the customer projection reached completion. See [the recorded proof](VERIFICATION_STATUS.md),
which also preserves the earlier September 5 test.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `24.x` and pnpm `11.9.0`
- Python `3.12.x` and `uv`
- Docker Desktop, for PostgreSQL and a local OpenSearch instance
- Temporal CLI or a locally running Temporal development server
- A local Vendure database with a customer, API key, and fulfilled test order
- An already-published local RAG index named by `KNOWLEDGE_INDEX_NAME`

Install dependencies once:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install

cd tools/simulators/commerce-sandbox
pnpm install

cd ../../../apps/services/agent-runtime
uv sync --dev

cd ../knowledge-rag
uv sync --dev
```

OpenSearch is an external local dependency. This repository does not yet provide
a one-command OpenSearch or knowledge-publication setup. The Knowledge/RAG service
needs OpenSearch on `127.0.0.1:9200` and a published release before it can return
evidence.

## Configure local environment files

Copy each service's `.env.example` to `.env`. Do not add any `.env` file to Git.

The local secrets have the following required relationships. Read
[Local Authentication and Secrets](LOCAL_AUTH_AND_SECRETS.md) before changing
them; it explains which values must match and which values must be different.

| Secret | Services that must share it | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTEXT_ASSERTION_HMAC_SECRET` | Edge API, Conversation Runtime, Integration Gateway, Agent Runtime, Knowledge/RAG, Human Operations for private photos | Edge-issued audience-specific customer context |
| `EDGE_SERVICE_ASSERTION_HMAC_SECRET` | Edge API, Conversation Runtime | Edge-only assistant-message commits; this must differ from every other secret |
| `WORKFLOW_ACCESS_HMAC_SECRET` | Workflow Workers, Integration Gateway | Worker-only fact refresh, refund execution, and reconciliation |
| `HUMAN_OPERATIONS_WORKFLOW_HMAC_SECRET` | Workflow Workers, Human Operations | Worker-only case open/close and evidence read/transition |
| `PROVIDER_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` | Integration Gateway only | Local signed provider outcome event verification |

`LOCAL_AUTH_HMAC_SECRET` belongs only to Edge API.
`HUMAN_ACCESS_HMAC_SECRET` belongs only to Human Operations. Keep every secret at
least 32 bytes and use different values for different purposes.

Conversation Runtime also requires `MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY_BASE64`: exactly 32
random bytes encoded as base64. It encrypts persisted chat text. Never reuse it
as an HMAC secret.

The two browser applications also need local development tokens:

```dotenv
# apps/web/customer-portal/.env
CSO_LOCAL_CUSTOMER_TOKEN=<output from the Edge API local:token command>

# apps/web/operations-console/.env
CSO_LOCAL_HUMAN_TOKEN=<output from the Human Operations local:token command>
HUMAN_OPERATIONS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3003
```

The Edge local customer token has a default and maximum lifetime of 30 days.
Generate a new one after it expires. The web applications keep the tokens
server-side and forward them to their backend services. Local sign-in sets an
HTTP-only session cookie; it does not put the JWT into browser JavaScript.

The staff CLI defaults to 30 days. Set `LOCAL_HUMAN_ACCESS_TTL_SECONDS=2592000`
in Human Operations `.env` so an older shorter override does not take precedence.
Check the effective local file:
Next.js `.env.local` overrides `.env`. On the September 5 owner setup, the customer
token is in `apps/web/customer-portal/.env.local`, while the staff token is in
`apps/web/operations-console/.env`. Replace only the effective token, restart that
web app, and choose **Continue locally** again. Never print tokens into logs.

For opt-in local telemetry, Edge API, Agent Runtime, Knowledge/RAG and Integration
Gateway each use these non-secret settings in their ignored service `.env` file:

```dotenv
CSO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:4318
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<unique-service-name>
OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION=0.1.0
```

Use a unique service name for every process. Telemetry is independent of login
tokens and signing secrets; enabling it must not require rotating either.

## Start the stack

Start each process in its own terminal. Start dependencies before callers.

### 0. Local observability backend, when tracing

```bash
docker compose -f infrastructure/observability/compose.yaml up -d
```

This exposes Grafana on loopback port 3300 and OTLP HTTP on 4318. A Grafana Cloud
account is not required. Stop it with the same Compose file and `stop`; preserve
the named volume and never use `down -v` for a dashboard-only refresh.

### 1. PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose -f infrastructure/local/compose.yaml up -d postgres

cd apps/services/integration-gateway
pnpm migrate

cd ../conversation-runtime
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://cso_local:cso_local@127.0.0.1:5432/customer_service_os pnpm migrate

cd ../human-operations
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://cso_local:cso_local@127.0.0.1:5432/customer_service_os pnpm migrate
```

### 2. Temporal

Start a local Temporal development server. The usual CLI command is:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

It should expose the Temporal gRPC endpoint on `127.0.0.1:7233` and the UI on
`http://127.0.0.1:8233`.

### 3. Vendure commerce simulator

```bash
cd tools/simulators/commerce-sandbox
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Integration Gateway

```bash
cd apps/services/integration-gateway
pnpm dev
```

### 5. Knowledge/RAG

```bash
cd apps/services/knowledge-rag
uv run uvicorn knowledge_rag.main:app --env-file .env --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

Knowledge/RAG retrieves only `CUSTOMER_SAFE` evidence for the active tenant and
knowledge release. The current customer workflow-status page does not yet expose
the generated answer or citations, so verify grounding through the Agent Runtime
response or its integration checks rather than expecting citations in that page.

### 6. Agent Runtime

```bash
cd apps/services/agent-runtime
uv run uvicorn agent_runtime.main:app --env-file .env --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 7. Conversation Runtime

```bash
cd apps/services/conversation-runtime
pnpm dev
```

It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3004`. Edge API signs short-lived customer
context for customer reads/writes and a separate Edge-only assertion for
assistant-message commits.

### 8. Human Operations

```bash
cd apps/services/human-operations
pnpm dev
```

### 9. Temporal Workflow Workers

```bash
cd apps/services/workflow-workers
pnpm dev
```

On the current Apple Silicon development setup, the Temporal Worker can fail on
Node 24 with `RangeError: Invalid atomic access index`. If that happens, run only
this terminal with Node `22.21.0`. The rest of the repository continues to use
Node 24. This is a local Temporal compatibility workaround, not the deployment
target.

### 10. Edge API

```bash
cd apps/services/edge-api
pnpm dev
```

### 11. Create fresh local browser tokens and start the interfaces

```bash
cd apps/services/edge-api
pnpm --silent local:token

cd ../human-operations
pnpm --silent local:token
```

Paste the first output into `apps/web/customer-portal/.env` and the second into
`apps/web/operations-console/.env`, then run these commands from the repository
root:

```bash
pnpm dev:customer
pnpm dev:operations
pnpm dev:admin
```

The customer and operations development servers intentionally use Webpack, which
has been more reliable than the current Turbopack setup on this local stack.

## Local URLs

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Customer UI | `http://127.0.0.1:3100/sign-in` |
| Operations Console | `http://127.0.0.1:3101/sign-in` |
| Admin Console shell | `http://127.0.0.1:3102` |
| Edge API health | `http://127.0.0.1:3000/health` |
| Vendure Dashboard | `http://127.0.0.1:3001/dashboard` |
| Integration Gateway health | `http://127.0.0.1:3002/health` |
| Human Operations health | `http://127.0.0.1:3003/health` |
| Conversation Runtime health | `http://127.0.0.1:3004/health` |
| Agent Runtime health | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` |
| Knowledge/RAG health | `http://127.0.0.1:8001/health` |
| OpenSearch | `http://127.0.0.1:9200` |
| Temporal UI | `http://127.0.0.1:8233` |
| Local Grafana | `http://127.0.0.1:3300/d/cso-foundation` |
| OTLP HTTP receiver | `http://127.0.0.1:4318` |

Use the exact `127.0.0.1` URLs above for browser testing. Local BFF routes accept
that development origin explicitly. Do not mix it with `localhost` in the same
test session.

## Test the safe takeover path

For new damaged-item requests pinned to `refund-policy-v2`, first follow
[Refund Photo Evidence](REFUND_PHOTO_EVIDENCE.md): apply migration 003, configure
private storage, upload a photo on the refund page, then have assigned staff
review the exact photo revision. Only after accepted evidence does policy route
the same case into monetary approval/takeover. Existing v1 workflows retain the
older behavior described below. A photo acceptance is not a refund approval.

1. Open the Customer UI and choose **Continue locally**.
2. On `/support`, enter a full request with a fresh valid local order reference.
   Replace `<ORDER_REFERENCE>` below. Historical orders such as
   `AVV8JSZH8G6ZZDMX` have already been used and may no longer be refundable:

   ```text
   I want a refund for order <ORDER_REFERENCE>. The item arrived damaged and I would like a full refund.
   ```

3. Submit the request. A high-value request should become **A specialist is
   helping**. This is expected, it is the deterministic takeover decision.
4. Open the Operations Console and choose **Continue locally**.
5. In the **Open** queue, open the newest case. Review the order reference,
   requested amount, policy reason codes, and evidence IDs.
6. Click **Claim this case**. After claiming, choose **Resolve manual takeover**,
   add a note, and submit it. This closes the review without a refund; it is
   different from **Approve exceptional refund plan**.
7. Return to the customer journey. Live updates should show **Support review
   completed**; refresh only if the connection is unavailable.

This path proves the human review and audit boundary without a commerce write.

## Test multi-turn order-reference retention

This is a regression test for conversational context. It may use the configured
model and create a local review case, but it does not execute a refund unless the
customer later confirms a preview.

Start with a fresh browser conversation. The simplest option is a private window.
Otherwise, open browser developer tools on the Customer Portal and run:

```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem("cso.current-conversation-id");
location.reload();
```

Then send these messages as two separate turns, leaving the optional order
reference field empty. Replace the placeholder with a fresh test order:

```text
I need help with a refund. My order reference is <ORDER_REFERENCE>.
```

```text
The item arrived damaged. I want a full refund for my entire order.
```

Pass condition: the second response must not ask the customer to share the order
reference again. It may request required evidence or create a high-value human
review case. This test passed through the local BFF, Edge API, Conversation
Runtime, Agent Runtime, MCP Gateway, Knowledge/RAG, and Temporal on 2026-09-04.
It passed again on September 5 with `23NK4CXW6XYMA5NE` and a correct proposed
USD 1,683.80. That order is now refunded; use a new one for another positive test.

For one local sample, the first and second Edge API turns took 20.68 and 18.82
seconds respectively. Conversation persistence and transcript reads were under 50
ms; model and RAG work inside Agent Runtime accounted for nearly all remaining
time. These are local development observations, not performance targets.

## Test a refund execution path carefully

For an order that policy allows or requires approval, the customer must review an
exact preview and choose **Confirm refund**. That confirmation signals Temporal;
it does not call Vendure from the browser. The Workflow Worker refreshes facts
again and calls the Integration Gateway's idempotent execution route.

For the exceptional takeover path, use a fresh USD order above USD 500 with one
settled simulated payment and no prior refunds, owned by the configured customer.
For damaged-item v2 requests, complete the private photo gate first: assigned
staff must accept the exact current photo revision. A clearer-photo request
supersedes that reviewed set without deleting it and opens a fresh current set.
The same case then changes to monetary takeover and clears its earlier assignment;
the supervisor must claim the monetary phase before deciding the refund plan.
The assigned supervisor first chooses **Approve exceptional refund plan** and
records a decision note. The workflow refreshes facts and prepares a preview;
only then does the customer confirm. Closing the human case after plan approval
does not mean the refund has executed.

Use a disposable local order for this test. Check the resulting refund in the
Vendure Dashboard, then inspect the workflow in Temporal UI. Do not use an
unknown real order or production credentials.

The customer journey first shows **Refund initiated**. This means the refund was
accepted by the commerce or payment boundary, but the system is waiting for an
authoritative final result. It moves to **Refund completed** only when Vendure
reconciliation finds a settled refund or a signed provider outcome event reports
completion. A failed provider event moves it to **Refund needs attention**.

The configured dummy payment handler leaves refunds `Pending`; it does not
automatically settle them. To simulate provider completion:

1. Obtain explicit permission to settle the existing local test refund.
2. Open the correct Vendure order, expand the payment's **Refunds**, and verify
   the existing refund ID and amount.
3. Choose **Settle refund** and enter a clearly labeled local test transaction ID.
   Do not click **Refund** again or call `refundOrder` a second time.
4. Verify the record is `Settled`. Keep Workflow Workers running and wait for the
   next normal reconciliation check, which runs every five minutes.
5. Verify Temporal becomes `REFUND_SUCCEEDED` and the customer page automatically
   shows **Refund completed**. Do not force a success signal to shorten the wait.

This moves no real bank money. A real payment provider may take days, and its
signed webhook is accepted at
`POST /internal/v1/provider-refund-events`. The Gateway records each event before
retrying delivery to Temporal. This endpoint is for a provider adapter, never a
browser client.

## Current browser behavior

- The Customer Portal owns only same-origin BFF routes. It does not call internal
  services directly.
- It maps internal workflow stages to customer-safe language and removes internal
  citations before rendering.
- The Operations Console supplies an idempotency key for claim and decision
  mutations and displays the review packet plus audit trail.
- The Customer Portal listens to a same origin SSE wake up stream and refetches
  the authoritative journey view. If that stream disconnects, it falls back to a
  ten second polling interval.
- Conversation context sent to Agent Runtime includes only bounded end-customer
  messages. Assistant messages are intentionally excluded, and RAG receives only
  the latest customer message.
- Refund destinations use readable labels. **Review by** appears only while
  confirmation is the next customer action, not during processing or after
  completion/closure/invalidation. The backend retains the original expiry.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| `pnpm: command not found` | Run `corepack enable`, open a new shell, then check `pnpm --version`. |
| Customer authentication required | Regenerate the Edge token, update the effective customer web env file (`.env.local` overrides `.env`), restart the Customer UI, and choose Continue locally. |
| Human authentication unavailable | Regenerate the Human Operations token, update `apps/web/operations-console/.env`, and restart the Operations Console. |
| Request origin is not allowed | Use `http://127.0.0.1:3100`, not a different host or port. |
| No human case appears | Verify Human Operations and Workflow Workers are running and connected to the same Temporal server. |
| RAG request fails | Verify OpenSearch, the configured published index, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Knowledge/RAG. |
| Grounded answer falls back to a generic message | Verify `REFUND_ANSWER_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30` in Agent Runtime or use its default, then restart Agent Runtime. The answer call gets one bounded 30-second attempt rather than repeated timeouts. |
| Assistant asks for an order reference that was provided in an earlier turn | Start a fresh conversation and run the multi-turn retention test above. If it repeats, inspect Edge API conversation-context tests before changing prompt wording. |
| Assistant calls an item number an order number | Regression fixed in the September 5 answer composer. Verify the running Agent Runtime includes the trusted-order input and fallback checks, then run its tests. |
| Assistant displays minor units as dollars | Regression fixed by application-owned USD formatting. Verify the `refund-answer-v3` path and its money/fallback tests are running. |
| Order lookup fails after manual Vendure fulfillment | On September 6, a blank provider method violated the order contract. Gateway now normalizes blank methods to `unspecified`; verify that adapter and its tests. Typed `order_lookup_unavailable` is a safe retryable Edge 503, not evidence that the order is missing. |
| Assistant asks for a delivery date during photo-gated intake | This unsupported question occurred in the successful September 6 browser run. The subsequent `SYSTEM_PROMPT` forbids delivery-date questions and delivery-age windows; runtime checks reject either wording so the existing graph safely falls back. The full Agent Runtime suite passed 101 tests with one upstream warning. A fresh paid live browser recheck has not been run. Trusted delivery-age eligibility remains unimplemented; do not treat a customer-supplied date as verified facts. |
| Refund remains initiated | Read the existing Vendure refund. Dummy-provider `Pending` needs explicitly authorized simulated settlement; `Settled` should be detected at the next five-minute reconciliation check. |
| Existing case disappeared after restart | This is not expected now. Verify PostgreSQL is running, `DATABASE_URL` points to the same database, Human Operations migrations ran, and the tenant/environment values did not change. |
| Provider event endpoint returns `503` | Set `PROVIDER_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` in the Integration Gateway `.env` and restart the Gateway. |

## What this does not prove yet

This local test does not prove production authentication, real bank settlement,
real payment-provider webhook delivery, delivery-age eligibility, managed
PostgreSQL backup/high availability, Kafka delivery, platform-wide production
observability, workload scaling, or AWS deployment. The implemented local
OpenTelemetry slice covers only Edge, Agent Runtime, Knowledge/RAG phases and
Gateway read-only commerce lookup; it is development evidence, not a production
monitoring claim.
Those are the next hardening and deployment milestones.

## Completed positive test and repeat procedure

The latest photo-gated positive path passed on 2026-09-06. Order
`AUUYAWRHBVGJPK5R` (Vendure order 2) contained two Laptop 13 inch 8GB units, with a
full-order refund of USD 3,122.60. Staff requested a clearer photo after the first
passed technical validation, accepted the replacement at its exact revision,
then the same case moved to monetary takeover. A supervisor approved the
exceptional plan and the customer confirmed the exact preview. Gateway created
only refund 5 (`Pending`); separate owner-authorized settlement changed that same
refund to `Settled`, with no second refund. Temporal reached `REFUND_SUCCEEDED`
and the customer projection reached `REFUND_COMPLETED` with no action.

[Verification Status](VERIFICATION_STATUS.md) records the workflow, case and
preview identifiers, the automated delivery wording safeguard checks, and the earlier
September 5 proof (order `23NK4CXW6XYMA5NE`, refund 4, USD 1,683.80). Neither order
is reusable for another positive execution. The earlier September 6 order-contract
recovery passed Gateway typecheck/44 tests, Edge typecheck/83 tests, Agent Runtime
Ruff/98 tests with one upstream warning, and live signed REST/MCP lookup. The later
wording safeguard passed the full 101-test Agent Runtime suite with the same
warning; it has not had a fresh paid live browser recheck.

For a future regression run:

1. Create and fulfill a disposable order in Vendure.
2. Submit a damaged-item refund from the Customer Portal.
3. For damaged-item v2 requests, upload a private photo and review its exact
   revision in the Operations Console. Exercise request-more and replacement,
   then accept the current set. If policy changes the same case to takeover,
   reclaim it as a supervisor and approve the exceptional refund plan.
4. Confirm the exact refund preview in the Customer Portal.
5. Observe `REFUND_PROCESSING` after provider acceptance.
6. Verify the single refund record in Vendure. If it is `Pending` under the dummy
   provider, separately authorize and settle that existing refund as above.
7. Verify a signed provider event or reconciliation moves Temporal to
   `REFUND_SUCCEEDED`.
8. Confirm the Customer Portal shows the truthful completed state.
9. Inspect the Temporal history, Human Operations audit trail, Conversation
   Runtime transcript, and Integration Gateway evidence.

Use a fresh disposable order and do not repeat confirmation against an already
refunded order.
